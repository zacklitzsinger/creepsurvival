Bugs
====
- Players can buy invalid items through the hero item suggestions

Goals
=====
- Finish a trial game mode to learn framework
- Several hero "classes": tank?, healer, DPS, and summoner

Tasks
=========
- Fully heal creeps between rounds
- Finish out remainder of map
- Map details
- Scoreboard for rounds
- Rework items and heroes
- New and more interesting creep camps

Ideas
=====
- Try out possibilities for aggro (not sure what's possible), perhaps make heroes not follow creeps around (closer to original game mode)
- Dominator/summon items
- Optional boss creeps
- Better final scoreboard (if possible)
- Randomized couriers to kill for gold bounty?
